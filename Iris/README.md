# Iris Flower Classification

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! In this project, we have built a machine learning model using logistic regression to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features. The dataset contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model that accurately predicts the species of iris flowers based on their features.

## Metrics

The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated using the following metrics:

  - **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
  - **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
  - **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
  - **F1 Score:** The weighted average of Precision and Recall.

## Results

After training and evaluating our logistic regression model, we achieved the following optimal performance metrics:

  - **Accuracy:** 96%
  - **Precision:** 96%
  - **Recall:** 96%
  - **F1 Score:** 96%
