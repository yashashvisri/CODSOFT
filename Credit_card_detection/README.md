# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! In this project, we have built a machine learning model using logistic regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains various transaction features, and our goal is to accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model that effectively identifies fraudulent credit card transactions based on transaction features.

## Metrics
The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated using the following metrics:

## Accuracy: 
The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.

## Precision:
The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
## Recall: 
The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
## F1 Score: 
The weighted average of Precision and Recall.

## Results
After training and evaluating our logistic regression model, we achieved the following optimal performance metrics:

Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 99%
Recall: 99%
F1 Score: 99%
