# Codsoft Internship Program

Welcome to the Codsoft Internship Program repository! This repository contains projects for Iris flower classification, Titanic survival prediction, and Credit card fraud detection. Each project aims to achieve optimal accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers.

#### Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project, we analyze the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and cabin. The objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic.

#### Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.7877094972067039
- Precision: 0.7877094972067039
- Recall: 0.7877094972067039
- F1 Score: 0.7877094972067039

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

The credit card fraud detection project involves identifying fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset containing various transaction features. The aim is to create a model that effectively detects fraudulent activities, minimizing financial losses for credit card companies and customers.

#### Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Evaluation Criteria

For each project, the following evaluation criteria are considered:

- **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
- **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
- **F1 Score:** The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
